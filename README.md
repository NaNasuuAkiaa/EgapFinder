# EgapFinder
Finds a good amount of enchanted golden apples in ruined portals near spawn

Program is set up for version 1.16.5. Precompiled version is for 1.16.5.
You can change that and recompile with shadowJar by changing the version 
on line 24 of the main. 

I can't promise the program will work on other versions, but you can try :)

Feel free to reach out to me if you can find a way to optimize the code. I made this quickly, but wanted to share either way.

Please don't redistribute, instead, link this project. Thanks.
